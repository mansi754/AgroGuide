            <h1>Brinjal</h1>
            <p>Brinjal, also known as eggplant, is a widely grown vegetable, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. It is rich in vitamins and minerals and has been cultivated for thousands of years for its edible fruit.</p>

            <h2>Cultivation and Growth</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Brinjal grows well in warm climates, requiring temperatures between 20°C and 30°C for optimal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Loamy, well-drained soils rich in organic matter are ideal for Brinjal cultivation.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Brinjal is typically grown from seeds, and seedlings are transplanted when they are about 6-8 weeks old.</li>
                <li><strong>Growth:</strong> The plant bears purple, white, or green fruits, depending on the variety, and requires consistent care to yield healthy crops.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Associated Diseases and Prevention</h2>
    <div class="disease-section">
        <!-- Disease 1: Leaf Spot -->
        <div class="disease-block">
            <h3>Leaf Spot</h3>
            <p>Leaf Spot is caused by fungi and leads to small, circular brown spots on the leaves. Severe infections can cause defoliation and reduced crop yield.</p>
            <div class="image-space">

            </div>
            <h4>Prevention:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove and destroy infected leaves to reduce the spread of the fungi.</li>
                <li>Apply fungicides when symptoms first appear.</li>
                <li>Ensure good air circulation by spacing plants appropriately.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Disease 2: Bacterial Wilt -->
        <div class="disease-block">
            <h3>Bacterial Wilt</h3>
            <p>Bacterial Wilt is caused by soil-borne bacteria, leading to wilting and plant death.</p>
            <div class="image-space">
                <img src="bacterial-wilt.jpg" alt="Bacterial Wilt Disease" />
            </div>
            <h4>Prevention:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Use disease-free seedlings and resistant varieties.</li>
                <li>Rotate crops with non-host plants like cereals to reduce soil contamination.</li>
                <li>Improve soil drainage to reduce bacterial growth.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Disease 3: Damping Off -->
        <div class="disease-block">
            <h3>Damping Off</h3>
            <p>Damping Off affects seedlings, causing them to collapse and die. The disease is caused by soil-borne fungi and thrives in wet, humid conditions.</p>
            <div class="image-space">
                <img src="damping-off.jpg" alt="Damping Off Disease" />
            </div>
            <h4>Prevention:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure well-drained soil and avoid overwatering seedlings.</li>
                <li>Apply fungicide treatments to seed beds before planting.</li>
                <li>Plant seedlings in raised beds to reduce soil moisture.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Disease 4: Little Leaf Disease -->
        <div class="disease-block">
            <h3>Little Leaf Disease</h3>
            <p>Little Leaf Disease is caused by phytoplasma and results in the stunting of leaves, causing them to be small and deformed.</p>
            <div class="image-space">
                <img src="little-leaf-disease.jpg" alt="Little Leaf Disease" />

            <ul>
                <li>Control insect vectors, such as leafhoppers, that spread the disease.</li>
                <li>Remove and destroy infected plants to prevent the spread.</li>
                <li>Use certified, disease-free planting material.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Disease 6: Mosaic Virus -->
        <div class="disease-block">
            <h3>Mosaic Virus</h3>
            <p>Mosaic Virus causes mottled patterns of yellow and green on leaves, reducing plant vigor and yield.</p>
