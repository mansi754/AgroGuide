            <h1>Tur</h1>
            <p>Tur, also known as pigeon pea, is a leguminous crop that is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. It is an important source of protein and is a staple in many diets across the globe. Tur is highly drought-resistant and plays a significant role in soil improvement through nitrogen fixation.</p>

            <h2>Cultivation and Growth</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Grows best in warm, semi-arid regions with moderate rainfall.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Prefers well-drained loamy or clayey soils with good organic content.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Typically planted during the rainy season for optimal growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Growth:</strong> Tur plants grow as small shrubs with deep roots, making them highly drought-tolerant.</li>
            </ul>
