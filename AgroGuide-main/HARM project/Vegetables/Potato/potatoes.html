            <h1>Potatoes</h1>
            <p>Potatoes are one of the most important staple crops globally, providing nutrition and sustenance to millions of people. Known for their versatility in cooking, potatoes are a major source of carbohydrates.</p>

            <h2>Cultivation and Growth</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Potatoes thrive in cool, temperate climates with well-distributed rainfall.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Well-drained, sandy loam soils rich in organic matter are ideal for potato cultivation.</li>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Potatoes are grown from seed tubers, which are planted in rows and require hilling to promote tuber development.</li>
                <li><strong>Growth:</strong> The crop needs consistent watering and protection from pests and diseases to ensure good yields.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Associated Diseases and Prevention</h2>
            <div class="disease-section">
                <!-- Disease 1: Late Blight -->
                <div class="disease-block">
                    <h3>Late Blight</h3>
                    <p>Late Blight is a fungal disease that affects both the foliage and tubers of potatoes. It can rapidly destroy crops in wet conditions and is a major threat to potato production.</p>
                    <div class="image-space">
                        <img src="late-blight.jpg" alt="Late Blight Disease" />
